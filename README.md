## Introduction

This project is aimed at electrical engineers, electricians, and students who need to perform various electrical calculations. The code is written in Assembly (ASM) language to ensure high performance and low-level hardware interaction.
Features

    - Load Calculations: Compute loads in kVA, kW, HP, BTU, and Amps.
    - Efficiency: Calculate the efficiency percentage of electrical devices.
    - Voltage Drop: Determine the voltage drop percentage over a distance.
    - Longitude: Calculate geographic longitude for electrical installation planning.
    - Breaker Selection: Select appropriate breakers for given loads.
    - Wire Sizing: Choose the correct wire size based on load and distance.
    - Tube Sizing: Select appropriate tubing for wiring.
    - AWG Selection: Determine the American Wire Gauge size needed for wiring.

## Installation
Prerequisites

    - An assembler compatible with the assembly code provided (e.g., NASM, MASM, etc.)
